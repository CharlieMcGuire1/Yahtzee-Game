Several things must be discussed in this ReadMe:
1. In order to access debug mode/'god' mode, you must do the following:
In either single player or multiplayer, move the mouse to the toolbar, slightly to the right of the rightmost button.
It should become apparent that there is a blank toolbar button there; press it and navigate to the enter code part
Enter the code CANE, which is an acronym from the about section message box. You have unlocked god mode!
2. In order for the fonts to function, it is necessary to have the ttf file in the directory at which the
executable is located
3. Have fun!
